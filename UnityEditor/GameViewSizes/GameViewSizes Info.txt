GameViewSizes

The Game view inside of the Unity editor has a little drop down menu that lists Available Resolutions and Aspect Ratios to show the Game view in.
This menu changes based on the current build type that the project is set to, so it will only show Android Resolution/Aspect Ratios when set to build for Android.

The GameViewSizes.asset is where the custom data lives, and it's based on the user/editor, and not the specific project.
 Windows Example (Unity 2018.3.0f2): C:\Users\<USER>\AppData\Roaming\Unity\Editor-5.x\Preferences\GameViewSizes.asset
